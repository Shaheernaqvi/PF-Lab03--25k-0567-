My name is Shaheer, a BSCS student at FAST NU with a deep passion for programming, microprocessor architecture, and low-level coding. Iâ€™m driven by curiosity to understand how software interacts with hardware, troubleshoot issues, and master coding skills. I aim to explore the processes behind modern computing systems.
